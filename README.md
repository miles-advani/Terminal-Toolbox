## Goals and Motivation

The primary goal of this project was to practice JavaScript and explore Node APIs. However, the inspiration for Terminal Toolbox came from a unique personal need. 

Working on a Mac with a small screen size, I prefer to keep my workspace uncluttered by hiding the upper and bottom menu bars. This means the system clock isn't always visible. As a developer, I spend a significant amount of time in the terminal, so I thought, why not bring the clock to the terminal? 

This led to the creation of Terminal Toolbox, starting with a simple feature to display the current time. The project has since grown, incorporating a variety of tools to enhance productivity and add a touch of fun to the terminal experience.
